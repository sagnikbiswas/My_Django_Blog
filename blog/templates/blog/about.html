    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hi, welcome to my blog where I mainly post DSA and other CS stuff that I find useful. This is a django website which I made following Corey M Schafer's tutorial series.</p>
    <p>Feel free to make an account and post stuff, but rich text editing is restricted to admin only.</p>
    <p>Contact me @ sagnikbiswas.official@gmail.com</p>
